# Measuring the parallelism

The aim of this folder is to collect the measure of the execution of the program and analyze it.
I have mixed python for data analysis and bash scripts for data collection (i.e. running the program).


**BEFORE** starting the script you must compile the program and put the executable file in this
directory, The name must be `spm_project`.

### Basic usage

To collect the data you should use the script.
